    "Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.\n",

As Kaggle Learn does not teach all the models available, this seems to be the obvious choice as to what would perform best. We could try out other models and compare, but for this notebook we will focus on correct feature selection, creative feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.\n",
