    "Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.\n",

    "### **Goal**\n",
    "It is your job to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Metric**\n",

    "The model we are going to use for this project is **XGBoost** or Extreme Gradient Boosting. As Kaggle Learn does not teach all the models available, this seems to be the obvious choice as to what would perform best.
