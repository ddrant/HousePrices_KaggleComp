    "## **Competition Description:**  \n",
    "Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.\n",

    "With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.  \n",

    "## **Evaluation**\n",
    "### **Goal**\n",
    "It is your job to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Metric**\n",
    "Submissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price. (Taking logs means that errors in predicting expensive houses and cheap houses will affect the result equally.)\n",

    "The model we are going to use for this project is **XGBoost** or Extreme Gradient Boosting. As Kaggle Learn does not teach all the models available, this seems to be the obvious choice as to what would perform best. We could try out other models and compare, but for this notebook we will focus on correct feature selection, creative feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.\n",
